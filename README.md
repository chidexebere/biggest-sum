# Biggest-Sum

## Description

A program to find the sequence of pairs and singles which give the biggest possible sum.

If you are given a list of integers, both positive and negative. Each integer in the list is paired with another element in the list or be a single element. Once the elements have been paired, the integers in the pairs are multiplied and the results are summed up - the sum will include the single elements.

### Examples:

1. for the list [0,1,2,3,4,5] the pairs (4,5) and (2,3) are formed and 0 and 1 are single elements. The max. sum is 27 - (20+6+0+1).
2. for the list [-1,0,1] the pairs (-1,0) is formed and 1 is a single element. The max. sum is 1.
3. for the list [1,1] no pairs are formed only two single elements. The max. sum is 2.
